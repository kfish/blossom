This is a loosely-categorized list of outstanding tasks and ideas for improving
blossom. When implementing any of these, please include an update to this TODO
file removing that task, in the same commit.

Template files
	* include example template files
	* install default template files
	* load default template files if none specified (ie. set up default
	config before overriding with user config)

Benchmarking
	* generate large blog archive (lorem ipsum?) with 1000s of entries
	* time generation of all html files in archive
	* do similar timing using blosxom, pyblosxom etc.
	* graph times: n entries vs. generation time for each system
